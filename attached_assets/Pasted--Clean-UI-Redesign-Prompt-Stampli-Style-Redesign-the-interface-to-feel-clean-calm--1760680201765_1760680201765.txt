### üé® **Clean UI Redesign Prompt (Stampli-Style)**

Redesign the interface to feel **clean, calm, and cohesive**, in line with Stampli‚Äôs modern AP aesthetic. The focus should be **clarity, whitespace, and hierarchy**, not decoration.

---

#### **Layout & Alignment**

* Fix all **alignment and spacing issues** ‚Äî use a consistent grid, even padding, and balanced margins across cards and sections.
* Maintain clear **vertical rhythm**: equal spacing between rows, consistent section headers.
* Align icons, buttons, and input fields precisely for visual flow.

---

#### **Typography & Hierarchy**

* Use **no more than two font sizes** (e.g., headline + body) and one consistent type weight.
* Avoid excessive bolding; emphasize hierarchy through **color contrast, spacing, or icons**, not font weight.
* Maintain generous line spacing and left alignment for readability.

---

#### **Visual Simplification**

* Remove redundant borders, dividers, and shadows ‚Äî rely on **whitespace for separation**.
* Replace repetitive text labels with **icon buttons, glyphs, pictograms, or visual affordances** wherever intuitive (e.g., üñä for edit, üóë for delete, ‚ûï for add).
* Ensure icons have **consistent size, stroke weight, and alignment**.
* Use **tooltips** on all icon-only buttons to clarify actions without cluttering the interface (e.g., hover over üñä shows ‚ÄúEdit Card‚Äù).

---

#### **Color & Highlight Rules**

* Establish **one primary action color** (Stampli teal #00B6C2 or equivalent) and **one secondary accent** (e.g., light blue or green for success states).
* Keep neutral grays for cards, dividers, and text; avoid multiple bright or competing colors.
* Use highlights **sparingly** ‚Äî only for active elements or alerts.
* Ensure hover/selected states are consistent and subtle (slight tint or underline).

---

#### **Interaction & Information Density**

* Use **progressive disclosure**: keep advanced details hidden until expanded or hovered.
* Add **tooltips** or **info icons (‚ìò)** to explain settings, spend limits, or controls inline without adding bulk text.
* Maintain at least **16‚Äì24 px padding** between interactive elements to improve touch/click clarity.

---

#### **Overall Tone**

The final design should feel **lightweight, professional, and user-centric** ‚Äî plenty of whitespace, consistent spacing, restrained typography, and intuitive iconography.
It should communicate **calm control** ‚Äî clear enough for an accountant, friendly enough for an AP clerk, and polished enough for a CFO dashboard.
